</div>

<div class='left'>
the calculator consist of :
<ul>
 <li>7 displays screens on the top </li> 
 <li>48 keys</li> 
 <li>a link, below the "casing" to this operating manual </li>
</ul>
It does mathematical calculations according to the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which has been widely implemented in the Hewlett Packard calculators' starting in the 1970's.<br>
This means that it uses a "stack", here the displays referenced as <em>x, y, z</em>, to execute the operations.
To enter a number we will use the number keys (the white ones) to set the number in the <strong>INPUT</strong> display then use the <strong>ENTER</strong> key to push it in the fist stack level (the <em>x</em> one).<br /><br />
</div>

<div class='gris'>
Before going into the details let's do a simple exercise by adding 4.5 to 3.8 :
<ul>
  <li> with the white keys tap in <strong>3.8</strong> which displays in the "input" display.
    <li>tap the <strong>ENTER</strong> key. The content of the input display is moved to the x register (calculation stack)</li>
      <li> with the white keys tap in <strong>4.5</strong> which displays in the "input" display.
     <li>tap the <strong>ENTER</strong> key again. The value of the x register is moved up to the y register and the content of the input display is moved to the x register. We have now 3.8 in the y register and 5.5 in the x register </li>   
     <li>tap the <strong>PLUS</strong> key (a blue one). The y register is added to the x one which now display the 8.3 value</li>
</ul>
Notice : if you tap directly the <strong>PLUS</strong> key after entering the second value (skipping the second <strong>ENTER</strong> key), the calculator will perform the entering step automtically. This will speed up the process.
</div>


<h2>The display area</h2>

<div class='centered'>
   <img src="images/display.png" alt="display" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class='left'>
  
  There are 7 displays grouped in 4 main areas:
  <ul>
    <li>the stack area includes the calculation registers named <em>x, y, z</em> and the memory register named <em>mem</em></li>
    <li>the <em>input</em> area is used to enter a new number, using the "white keys" (see below key pad)</li>
    <li>the <em>results</em> area show the last 15 operations done by the calculator </li>
    <li>The <em>info</em> area show by default the angle mesurement unit (radian / degrees) and the display mode (fixed or scientific, number of decimales). When needed it also shows a temporary warning message. </li>
  </ul>  
</div>


<h2>The keyboard area</h2>

<div class='centered'>
   <img src="images/keyboard.png" alt="keyboard" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class='left'>
  
  There are 48 keys grouped in 3 main categories:
  <ul>
    <li>the white keys, including the figures from 0 to 9, the decimal point, the minus sign... that is to says the ones used to enter a new number</li>
    <li>the grey keys which are related to stack and memory manipulations, display modes... </li>
    <li>the blue keys which are used for mathematical operations </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class='left'>
  <h3>The white keys</h3>
  <strong>0 to 9</strong> numbers<br />
  <strong>.</strong> decimal point
  <strong>-</strong> minus sign, used to enter negative numbers or negative exponent. example : -123 or 456E-3. It should not be confused with the mathematical operation minus, which substact one nulber to an other one.<br />
  <strong>E</strong> exponent sign. <br />
  <strong>C</strong> for clear. Remove the last entered sign from the input display.<br />
  <strong>AC</strong> for all clear. Erase the input display. 
</div>

<div class='left'>
  <h3>The grey keys</h3>
  <strong>ENTER</strong> enter the current input value in the first level of the pile, x, and erase the input display<br />
  <strong>PI</strong> the mathematical Pi value<br />
  <strong>STO</strong> for store. The current x value is stored in the memory register. <br />Notice that is a value is set in the input register, it will be moved to the x ones, then stored to the memory.<br />Storing a value innteh memory doesn't erase it from the x register.<br />
   <strong>RCL</strong> for recall. The stack is moved up and the current memory value is stored in the x register.<br />Recalling a value from memory doesn't erase it from the memory register
  <strong>SWAP</strong> for clear. Remove the last entered sign from the input display.<br />
  <strong>DUP</strong> for duplicate the x register. y is moved to z, and y is set to x .<br /> 
  <strong>DROP</strong> for dropping. The stack is moved down: x is set to y ,y is set to z. z is set to 0. Notice that the original x value is lost.<br />
  <strong>SWAP</strong> for swap. The values of the x register and the y one are exhanged.<br />
  <strong>CSTK</strong> for clear stack. All stack registers and the memory register are set to 0<br />
  <strong>DEG</strong> for degree. All trigonometric calculations will be done using degree unit.<br />
  <strong>RAD</strong> for radian. All trigonometric calculations will be done using radian unit.<br />
  <strong>D+</strong> for decimal +. Increase the number of displayed decimal by one. Notice that the number of decimals is limited to 8.<br />
  <strong>D-</strong> for decimal -. Decrease the number of displayed decimal by one. Notice that the minimum number of decimals is 0.<br />
  <strong>FIX</strong> for fixed mode. Set the fixed mode wher numbers are represented directly, without exponents.<br />Notice : some numbers, big ones, or with lotof displayed decimals, could be to large to be displayed (more than 16 characters. When this happen the calculator will automatically move to the scientific mode. A warning message will be displayed in the info display.
  <strong>SCI</strong> for scientific mode. Number are displayed with a mantissa and an exponent. Example: 123.45 is displayed as 1.23e+2<br />
  <strong>CRST</strong> for clear results. This will clear the results display. New display will start with the <strong>CRST</strong> command and the last x value<br />
</div>

<div class='gris'>
Notice : in order to speed up the data entry into the pile, when a number is set in the input display, when the <strong>PI</strong> and the <strong>STO</strong> keys are tapped the transfert from the input register to the x register will be done directly, the <strong>ENTER</strong> key being optionnal.<br />
Example : <strong>123.45 STO</strong><br />
is equivalent to <strong>123.45 ENTER STO</strong><br />
This is also the case for all the following mathematical operations, the blue keys.
